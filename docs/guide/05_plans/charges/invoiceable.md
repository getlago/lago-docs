:::note Premium feature âœ¨

If a charge needs to be [paid in advance](cadence#charges-paid-in-advance), you can choose whether or not it generates an invoice.

The `"invoiceable": false` option is particularly relevant for fintech companies that want to charge customers instantly without issuing an invoice. This feature can be useful for banking transactions like ATM withdrawals, FX transfers and other similar scenarios.

By setting the invoiceable parameter to false, you can streamline the payment process, eliminating the step of generating invoices for these specific charges.
