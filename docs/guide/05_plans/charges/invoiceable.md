# Invoiceable
:::note Premium feature ✨
Only users with a premium license can define whether or not a charge is invoiceable. Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.
:::

If a charge is paid in advance, indicating that Lago creates a fee upon direct changes in usage, **you have the option to choose whether to invoice it or not.**

The `invoiceable`: `false` option is particularly relevant for fintech companies that require immediate charging without the need to issue an invoice. This feature is especially useful for banking transactions like ATM withdrawals, FX transfers, and other similar scenarios.

By setting the invoiceable parameter to false, you can streamline the payment process, eliminating the step of generating invoices for these specific charges. This flexibility enables fintech businesses to offer efficient and seamless financial transactions, aligning with the specific needs of their customers.
