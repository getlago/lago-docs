# Package

Select the package charge model if you want to apply a **fixed price to a range of units**. You also have the ability to offer free units.

Let's take back the example of our API company. You may want to charge $5 per 100 units and offer the first 100 units. In this example, 201 units would cost $0 (first 100 units) + $5 (next 100 units) + $5 (last unit) = $10.
