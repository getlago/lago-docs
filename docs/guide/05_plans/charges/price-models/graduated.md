# Graduated

Select the graduated charge model if you want to define **several price tiers**. This charge model allows you to apply a discount depending on the number of units consumed. You can also apply a **flat fee** to an entire tier.

Let's take back the example of the API company. You could charge $1 per unit for the first 100 units (first 100 API calls), then $0.50 per unit for the next 100 calls and finally, $0.10 for any additional unit.

Please refer to the tooltip in the user interface for more information.
