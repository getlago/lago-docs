# Overview
Add-ons are a useful feature that allows you to add a fixed charge that is not recurring to one-off invoices. This can be used to apply one-time fees such as a *setup fee*, *one-time payment*, or *customer success fee*.

To create an add-on through the user interface, follow these steps:

1. Access the **"Add-ons"** section via the side menu;
2. Click **"Add an add-on"**;
3. Choose a name, a code, and a description (optional) for your add-on;
4. Define its default value and currency (these values can be overwritten when creating the invoice); and
5. Click **"Add add-on"** to confirm.

In the add-ons section, you can edit or delete add-ons by clicking the ellipsis icon. Editing allows you to modify the name, code, description, and settings of the add-on, while deleting removes the add-on from the list (this action cannot be undone). Please note that you cannot edit or delete an add-on that has already been applied to a customer.

To assign an add-on to a customer, you need to create a one-off invoice. Simply select the add-on(s) you wish to apply from the add-ons section while creating the invoice, and the fixed charge will be added to the total amount due.
