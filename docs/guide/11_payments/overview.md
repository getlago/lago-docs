# Overview
Lago helps you monitor usage and calculates how much each customer owes you. However, **Lago is not a payment service provider (PSP)**.

To collect payments from your customers, you can:
1. Use our [native integration with Stripe Payments](stripe-integration) (requires a Stripe account); or
2. Use the webhooks sent by Lago to transmit billing information to your PSP (e.g. Paddle, Adyen, internal ledger, etc.).

Lago is agnostic, which means that you can use our open-source billing API with any PSP.
