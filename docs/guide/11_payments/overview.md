# Overview
Lago helps you monitor usage and calculates how much each customer owes you.

However, **Lago is not a payment service provider (PSP)**.

To collect payments from your customers, you can:
1. Use our native integrations with [GoCardless](gocardless-integration) and [Stripe Payments](stripe-integration); or
2. Use the [webhooks](../../api/webhooks/messages) sent by Lago to transmit billing information to your PSP (e.g. Paddle, Adyen, internal ledger, etc.).

Lago is **agnostic**, which means that you can use our billing solution with any PSP.
