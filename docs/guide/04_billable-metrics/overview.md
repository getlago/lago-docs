# Overview

Billable metrics define how incoming events are aggregated in order to measure consumption. If you want to charge your customers for the use of a particular feature, then you should create the corresponding billable metric.

To add a new billable metric through the user interface:
- Enter its `name`;
- Assign it a `code` which will be used as the name of the event sent from your backend;
- Add a `description` *(optional)*; and
- Select the `aggregation type` which will define how consumption will be measured.

The next section describes the different [aggregation types](./aggregation-types). In addition to this, we have added some [examples](./aggregation-examples) to help you understand the relationship between incoming events and billable metrics.
