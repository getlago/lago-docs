# Customers

## Create a customer
You can create or update a customer both from the API or the user interface. The entire customer's information can be retrieved from the customer detailed view, available on the UI.

### Mandatory fields
To create a customer, 2 mandatory information are required:
- An `external_id` <Required>(Required)</Required>: usual good practice is to send the unique id from your backend;
- A customer `name` <Required>(Required)</Required>: name of the customer.

:::caution
You cannot change the `external_id` of a customer with an active subscription (active plan assigned to this customer).
:::

### Additional fields
In addition to this, you can add optional information to a customer. **This additional information is useful for invoicing.** Here is the list of optional fields that can be retrieved for a customer:
- An `address_line1` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: first line of the billing address of your customer;
- An `address_line2`<Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: second line of the billing address of your customer;
- A `city` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: city of the customer's billing address;
- A `country` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: country code of the customer's billing address;
- An `email` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: main email of the customer;
- A `legal_name` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: legal company name of the customer;
- A `legal_number` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: legal company number of the customer;
- A `logo_url` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: logo URL of the customer;
- A `phone` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: phone number of the customer;
- A `state` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: state of the customer's billing address;
- An `url` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: custom URL of the customer (domain url);
- A `vat_rate` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: custom VAT applied to the customer. (It will override the one defined at organization level);
- A `zipcode` <Optional>(Optional)</Optional>: zipcode of the customer's billing address.

:::info
These additional fields can be added later on by updating a customer.

### Example of customer's information
```json title="Customer's information example"
{
  "customer": {
    "external_id": "5eb02857-a71e-4ea2-bcf9-57d3a41bc6ba",
    "address_line1": "5230 Penfield Ave",
    "address_line2": null,
    "city": "Woodland Hills",
    "country": "US",
    "email": "dinesh@piedpiper.test",
    "legal_name": "Coleman-Blair",
    "legal_number": "49-008-2965",
    "logo_url": "http://hooli.com/logo.png",
    "name": "Gavin Belson",
    "phone": "1-171-883-3711 x245",
    "state": "CA",
    "url": "http://hooli.com",
    "vat_rate": 12.5,
    "zipcode": "91364"
  }
}
```

## Update a customer
You can update a customer anytime you need by using the same endpoint. To do so, you just need to pass in the payload the `external_id` of the customer you want to update.

## Delete a customer
You can delete a customer **only if this customer does not have an active subscription** (active plan assigned to this customer).

## Assigning a plan to a customer
You can create a subscription by assigning a plan to a customer. By creating a subscription, all the charges (base charge and additional charges) are appended to this customer. By ingesting events, the usage will be charged following the prices belonging to the current subscription's plan.

**From both the UI and the API, you can:**
- Create a subscription by assigning a plan to a customer
- Change a subscription by assigning a new plan to a customer
- Terminate a subscription

## Ingesting events for a customer
Before sending event to a customer as usage measurement, **you must define [billable metric(s)](./billable-metrics/overview) from the UI.** The `code` of the billable metric is passed as a parameter of the event. Each paying feature of your product is a distinct billable metric and has a proper event `code`.

By sending an event to a customer, you are assigning a usage-based consumption from your application.

In Lago, all ingested events must hold an `external_customer_id`, as shown in the following example:

```json title="Event example"
{
  "event": {
    "transaction_id": "__UNIQUE_ID__", // unique id of the event
    "external_customer_id": "__CUSTOMER_ID__", // id of your customer
    "code": "__EVENT_CODE__", // code of the targeted billable metric
    "timestamp": 1650893379,
    "properties": {
      "custom_field": 12
    }
  }
}
```
Events represents the data delivered to Lago application that are aggregated into billable metrics. At the end of each billable period, Lago automatically aggregates those events into a billable metric with priced units that have been consumed by a customer. By clicking the following link, you can [know more about the aggregation types](./billable-metrics/aggregation-types).

## Displaying customer current usage
After assigning a plan to a customer and start ingesting usage-based events, it is often useful to know what is the **current usage** of this specific customer during the ongoing billable period.
This current usage displays:
- The total amount of usage that will be billed in the next invoice;
- The breakdown per usage-based charges (number of units consumed and amount to be billed).

To access this feature, select a specific customer and access the `Usage` tab.

On top of this, you can fetch via the API the current usage of a specific customer using the following endpoint `GET /api/v1/customers/:external_customer_id/current_usage`.

## Invoicing a customer
Lago automatically generates an invoice for all your customers at the end of each billing period.

## Customer Slug
The customer slug is a unique identifier for a customer that will be used to build an invoice number.
This slug respect this format:
- `LAG-1234-001`
- `LAG` is the first 3 letters of the customer's organization
- `1234` is the last 4 characters of the customer's organization's id
- `001` is the `sequential_id` of the customer scoped on the organization
