## Create a customer
You can create or update a customer via the API or the user interface. Customer information can be retrieved from the customer detailed view, available on the app.

### Mandatory fields
To create a customer, 2 mandatory information are required:
- An `external_id` <Required>(Required)</Required>: usual good practice is to send the unique id from your backend;

:::caution
You cannot change the `external_id` of a customer with an active subscription (active plan assigned to this customer).
:::

### Additional fields
In addition to this, you can add optional information to a customer. This information may appear on invoices.

Here is the list of optional fields that can be retrieved for a customer:

### Example of customer information
```json title="Example of customer information"
{
  "customer": {
    "external_id": "5eb02857-a71e-4ea2-bcf9-57d3a41bc6ba",
    "address_line1": "5230 Penfield Ave",
    "address_line2": null,
    "city": "Woodland Hills",
    "country": "US",
    "currency": "USD",
    "email": "dinesh@piedpiper.test",
    "legal_name": "Coleman-Blair",
    "legal_number": "49-008-2965",
    "logo_url": "http://hooli.com/logo.png",
    "name": "Gavin Belson",
    "phone": "1-171-883-3711 x245",
    "state": "CA",

      "payment_provider": "stripe",

    }
  }
}
```

## Update a customer
You can update a customer anytime you need by using the same endpoint. To do so, you just need to pass in the payload the `external_id` of the customer you want to update.

## Delete a customer
You can delete a customer **only if this customer does not have an active subscription** (active plan assigned to this customer).

## Assigning a plan to a customer
You can create a subscription by assigning a plan to a customer. By creating a subscription, all the charges (base charge and additional charges) are appended to this customer. By ingesting events, the usage will be charged following the prices belonging to the current subscription's plan.

Via the UI and the API, you can:
- Create a subscription by assigning a plan to a customer;
- Change a subscription by assigning a new plan to a customer; and
- Terminate a subscription.

## Ingesting events for a customer
Before sending events, you must define your [billable metrics](./billable-metrics/overview). The `code` of the billable metric is passed as a parameter of the event. Each paying feature of your product is a distinct billable metric and has its own event `code`.

An event is a usage record associated with a customer. All ingested events must hold an `external_customer_id` or `external_subscription_id`, as shown in the following example:

```json title="Event example"
{
  "event": {
    "transaction_id": "__UNIQUE_ID__", // unique id of the event
    "external_customer_id": "__CUSTOMER_ID__", // id of your customer
    "external_subscription_id": "__SUBSCRIPTION_ID__", // id of the subscription associated with the customer
    "code": "__EVENT_CODE__", // code of the corresponding billable metric
    "timestamp": 1650893379,
    "properties": {
      "custom_field": 12
    }
  }
}
```
Events represents the data delivered to Lago application that are aggregated into billable metrics. At the end of each billing period, Lago automatically aggregates those events into a billable metric with priced units that have been consumed by a customer. [Learn more](./billable-metrics/aggregation-types)

## Displaying customer current usage
After assigning a plan to a customer and start ingesting usage-based events, it is often useful to know what is the current usage of this specific customer during the ongoing billable period.
This current usage displays:
- The total amount of usage that will be billed in the next invoice; and
- The breakdown per usage-based charges (number of units consumed and amount to be billed).

To access this feature, select a specific customer and access the `Usage` tab.

On top of this, you can fetch via the API the current usage of a specific customer using the following endpoint `GET /api/v1/customers/:external_customer_id/current_usage`.

## Invoicing a customer
Lago automatically generates an invoice for all your customers at the end of each billing period. [Learn more](./invoicing/overview)

## Customer Slug
The customer slug is a unique identifier for a customer that will be used to build an invoice number.
This slug respect this format:
- `LAG-1234-001`
- `LAG` is the first 3 letters of the customer's organization
- `1234` is the last 4 characters of the customer's organization's id
- `001` is the `sequential_id` of the customer scoped on the organization
