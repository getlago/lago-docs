# Document locales

List of accepted locales for documents (ISO 639-1).

| Code | Document language |
|--|--|
| `en` | English |
| `fr` | French |
| `nb` | Norwegian (Bokmål) |

## How to add a new language

You can contribute to Lago's open-source project by helping us translate documents. The new language will then be added to the list of supported locales and available to the entire Lago Community.

The document template includes translation keys for:
- Invoices related to subscriptions, add-ons and prepaid credits;
- Credit notes;
- Data formatting (e.g. amounts and dates); and
- Syntax (i.e. sentence structure).

:::info
The names of your billable metrics, plans, add-ons, coupons and wallets are defined in the app. There are no keys to translate them.
:::

To add a new language:
1. [Download the document template](../../../static/files/doc-template.pdf) to see where each key is located;
2. Use the JSON file below to provide translations for the new language; and
3. Send the new JSON file to [hello@getlago.com](mailto:hello@getlago.com), so that we can review it and add it to the codebase.

Thanks for your time and support!

Same logic when removing a unit used during 10 days, we multiply the price by 10/31.
