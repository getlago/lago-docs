# Download an Invoice

## Route

```curl title="POST"
/api/v1/invoices/:id/download
```

## Logic

- If the invoice has already been generated, you will receive in the response the `invoice` object with the `file_url` where you can download your pdf file.
- If the invoice has never been generated, this endpoint will returns an empty `200` response, you will receive a `invoice.generated` webhook when the PDF file is ready.
  You can check the webhook documentation to know more about this.

## Responses

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="200" label="HTTP 200" default>

  * The `invoice` file has already been generated: Returns an [applied add-on](./applied-add-on-object) object.
  * The `invoice` file has not been generated, returns an empty response.


  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="404" label="HTTP 404">

  ```json
  {
    "status": 404,
    "error": "Bad Request"
  }
  ```

  The `invoice` is not found.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="401" label="HTTP 401">

  ```json
  {
    "status": 401,
    "error": "Unauthorized"
  }
  ```

  Access to the API endpoint is unhautorized.

  **Possible reasons are:**
  * The `Authorization` header is missing
  * The `Authorization` header does not contain the API key
  * The Api key is invalid or expired
