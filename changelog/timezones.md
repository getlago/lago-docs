# Timezones
You can now set the timezone of your organization in the settings of the app.

To do so:
1. Access the **"Settings"** section via the side menu;
2. In the **"Organization"** tab, you will see the current timezone (UTC by default);
3. Click **"Edit"**;
4. Select a new timezone from the list; and
5. Click **"Save timezone"** to confirm.

The organization's timezone applies to all customers by default and determines when billing periods start and end (i.e. when invoices should be generated).

It can also be set through the API using this [endpoint](../docs/api/organizations/update-organization).

The organization's timezone can be overwritten by the customer's timezone ([learn more](../docs/guide/customers#invoicing-a-customer)).

:::tip
You can hover over any date in the app to see the reference timezones.
