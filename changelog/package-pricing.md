# Package pricing for charges

It is now possible to apply a [package pricing model](../docs/guide/plans/charges/price-models/package) to a charge. To do so:
1. Select an existing plan (or create a new one);
2. Add a charge; and
3. Select the package pricing model.

This new pricing model allows you to apply a flat fee to a range of units. The price will be fixed for the entire range, regardless of the number of units consumed by the customer during the billing period.
