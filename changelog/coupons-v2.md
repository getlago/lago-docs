# Enhanced coupon model
We have improved the coupon model to offer more flexibility.

Changes include (but are not limited to):
1. Ability to define the value of a coupon as a fixed amount or percentage;
2. Ability to create recurring coupons that apply over several billing periods; and
3. Ability to set an expiration date (i.e. date after which the coupon can no longer be redeemed).
