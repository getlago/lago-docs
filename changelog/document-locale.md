# Document translation
PDF files including invoices and credit notes can be generated in different languages.

The [default language](../docs/guide/invoicing/download-invoices#translate-invoices) that is set at the organization level can be overwritten by the [customer's preferred language](../docs/guide/06_customers/invoice_customer.md#preferred-language)

In the API, the `document_locale` attribute determines the language of the documents.

You can contribute to Lago's open-source project by helping us translate documents. The new language will then be added to the [list of supported locales](../docs/api/resources/locales) and available to the entire Lago Community.
