# Multiple plans
It is now possible to assign multiple plans to a customer (e.g. if your customer needs to create several workspaces on your platform, you can link a plan to each workspace).

To help differentiate each plan, you can add display names that will appear in the user interface and on invoices.

Kindly note that:
1. All plans must be denominated in the same currency; and
2. You must now specify the `subscription_id` for each event or create batch events.
