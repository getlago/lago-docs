# Pay-as-you-go template
We've added a new template to our collection: [click here](https://www.getlago.com/resources/templates/algolia) to learn how to replicate Algolia's pay-as-you-go pricing.

It's a great starting point for companies whose pricing fully depends on usage, such as cloud service providers and API companies.

With Lago, you can adapt this template to your products and services, using some of our most popular features, including the ['sum' aggregation type](../docs/guide/billable-metrics/aggregation-types#2-sum) and the [package charge model](../docs/guide/plans/charges/price-models/package).
