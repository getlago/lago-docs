# Minimum spend on charges âœ¨
:::note Premium feature
This feature is only available to users with a premium license. Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.
:::

You can now define minimum spending requirements for usage-based charges.

The minimum spend is defined as an amount excluding tax. If at the end of the billing period, your customer has spent less than the minimum, then Lago will automatically generate a true-up fee to compensate for the difference.

Minimum spending requirements are defined when creating or editing plans, either through the user interface or the API.
