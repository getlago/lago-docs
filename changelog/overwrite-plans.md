# Overwrite plans
If after a negotiation phase, you need to create a custom plan for an important customer, you can use the 'overwrite' feature, available through the user interface.

This feature allows you to create a new plan from an existing one, in order to adjust the plan model and charges according to your business needs.

Overwriting a plan has no impact on the original plan or existing subscriptions.
