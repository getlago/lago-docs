# One-off invoices
After creating an [add-on](../docs/guide/addons/overview), you can use it to generate a one-off invoice that will be billed instantly.

A one-off invoice may include multiple fees (i.e. multiple add-ons). You can add a custom description and set a specific price for each add-on, either through the user interface or the API.

:::caution
The endpoint to [apply add-ons](../docs/api/add_ons/apply-add-on) is deprecated and will be removed on September 1st, 2023. It has been replaced with the endpoint to [create one-off invoices](../docs/api/invoices/create-invoice).
