2. Open the **"Members"** tab;
3. Click **"Invite a member"** on the right;
4. Enter the email address of your teammate;
5. Click **"Generate invitation link"** to confirm; and
6. Copy the invitation link to share it with your teammate.

Invitation links have no expiration date. When your teammate clicks the link, they can choose their password and then access the account.
