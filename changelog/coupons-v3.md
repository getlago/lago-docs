# Apply several coupons
You can now apply several coupons to a customer account.

When several coupons are applied to a customer, they will be deducted according to the date on which they were applied: the coupon that was applied first will be deducted first.

The remaining value / number of remaining periods for each coupon will be visible in the **"Overview"** tab of the customer view.

You can also use `GET /api/v1/applied_coupons` to retrieve all coupons applied to a customer.
