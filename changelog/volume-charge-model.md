# Volume charge model
The new volume charge model allows you to create a tiered pricing structure and then calculate a unit price that applies to all units depending on total volume.

It is similar to the graduated charge model, except that only one price tier applies at the end of the billing period.

Please refer to [the guide](../docs/guide/plans/charges/price-models/volume) and [API documentation](../docs/api/plans/create-plan) for more information.
