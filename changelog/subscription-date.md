# Past and future subscription dates
It is now possible to set a start date in the past or in the future for a new subscription.

Setting a start date in the past can be useful when migrating existing customers to Lago, while setting a start date in the future can be useful for scheduling upcoming subscriptions.

For more information about the impact of the start date on the invoicing process, please refer to [the documentation](../docs/guide/plans/subscription#subscription-date).
