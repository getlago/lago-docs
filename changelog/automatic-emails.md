# Automatic emails âœ¨
:::note Premium feature
This feature is only available to users with a premium license. Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.
:::

We are introducing a new built-in invoicing feature, which allows you to automatically send invoices and credit notes from Lago to your customers.

The email template can be customized with the name, email address and logo of your organization, and will be sent in the customer's preferred language (or the default language defined in the settings of your account).

For cloud users, Lago takes care of the SMTP setup. For users on the self-hosted version, the setup is described in the public documentation.
