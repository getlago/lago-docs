# Lago Open API
We have developed an Open API to help you get started with Lago and make it easier to test our solution.

Please refer to the [documentation](../docs/guide/openapi) to learn how to import the Lago Open API into Postman and create a new collection.

Our [public repository](https://github.com/getlago/lago-openapi) is also available on GitHub.
