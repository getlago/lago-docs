# Credit notes
You can now use your Lago account to issue credit notes for subscription invoices and add-ons.

Depending on the payment status of the invoice, you will be able to:
- Refund the customer (only for paid invoices); and/or
- Credit back the customer's account.

Please refer to the [documentation](../docs/guide/credit_notes) for more information on credit notes and credit methods.
