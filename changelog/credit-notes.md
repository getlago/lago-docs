# Credit notes âœ¨
:::note Premium feature
Lago may automatically generate a credit note when a subscription is upgraded or downgraded. However, only users with a premium license can manually generate credit notes via the user interface or the API. Please **[contact us](mailto:hello@getlago.com)** to get access to Lago Cloud and Lago Self-Hosted Premium.
:::

You can now use your Lago account to issue credit notes for subscription invoices and add-ons.

Depending on the payment status of the invoice, you will be able to:
- Refund the customer (only for paid invoices); and/or
- Credit back the customer's account.

Please refer to the [documentation](../docs/guide/credit_notes) for more information on credit notes and credit methods.
