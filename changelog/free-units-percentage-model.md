# Free units for the percentage charge model
We have released an enhanced version of the percentage charge model, including:
- Ability to define free units based on the number of events (e.g. first 3 events are free); and
- Ability to define free units based on the total amount (e.g. first $500 are free).

Please refer to the [documentation](../docs/guide/plans/charges/price-models/percentage) for more information.
